You find yourself in a strange place, with only this unknown girl as your guide. Walk with her, and perhaps you'll learn more...

Please note, after the story section indicated by the estimated completion time, the ghost will change to a general random talk pool.
I have added an indicator to the menu so you can tell when this has happened. There is additional dialogue, but the main story is considered complete, so please feel free to move on once you have reached this stage.
